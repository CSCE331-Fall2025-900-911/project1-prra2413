    <h2 class="right-angle">Who I Am</h2>
    <p>My name is Pranav Rao. I am currently an undergraduate student at Texas A&M University - College Station pursuing a degree in computer science. I am currently in my Junior year. When I first started thinking about my career in high school, I was originally inclined towards the medical field. I ultimately decided to pursue a career in computer science. My decision was influenced through experiences I had built up to go pursue a career in medicine. During my time volunteering at a hospital, I got to see first hand the backbone that IT and technology gave to the hospital, holding records with patient history to diagnostic equipment. The experience gave me insight on how I can pursue my interests in both medicine and computer science through computer science. It also gave me insight on how computer science has made and is still making an impact on every career field.
    <br><br>After I made the shift to computer science, I realized that I enjoyed the problem solving methodology of the field more than I did the brute force memorization of the medical field. I started learning the basics of computer science, and as I got more familiar with that, I started getting more interested in Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence. I involved myself in professor-led researches and personal projects, and self-studied a lot of the knowledge I know today. On top of this, I am currently working on research that showed me the impact of computer science in other fields. Specifically, I worked on running fluid mechanic simulations for enhanced oil recovery. Overall, I have come to really enjoy the field and hope to do more to enhance my knowledge and skills.
