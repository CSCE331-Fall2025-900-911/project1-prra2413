          <li>
            <h3>Machine Learning & AI</h3>
            <p class="sub">
              With my experience with simple and deep learning models, and attention mechanisms, I realized that I greatly enjoy the field of ML/AI. I am particularly interested in NLP and computer vision, and their applications, especially in other fields like the medical field.

          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Software Engineering (Full-Stack)</h3>
            <p class="sub">
              Full Stack web development is something I have worked but am still looking to improve on. I always thought I mainly wanted to do backend work, but I have come to realize that I like the creative aspect frontend work brings to projects.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
            <p class="sub">
              Cybersecurity is a field I have very little experience in. While true that I have worked on a cybersecurity research project, most of my work was in the frontend and backend part, and I didn't gain much experience in cybersecurity itself. It's still a field I am very interested in though.
