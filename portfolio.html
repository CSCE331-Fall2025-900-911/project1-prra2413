                <h3>News Article Summarization with Transformers</h3>
                <p>
                    Fine-tuned BART and Longformer encoder decoder transformers for abstractive news summarization, leveraging self-attention for summary generation and cross-attention for contextualization.
                    Analyzed token length distributions and applied input/output truncation to balance context retention with efficient transformer training.
                    Processed a multi-GB dataset, and optimized GPU training through gradient checkpointing, gradient accumulation, and FP16.

                <h3>Sleep Disorder Classifier (XGBoost)</h3>
                <p>
                    Developed an XGBoost algorithm to predict sleep disorders using metrics such as sleep duration, quality, BMI, blood pressure, and heart rate, achieving 92% accuracy. Applied data preparation techniques, including normalization, label and one-hot encoding, and feature selection, to enhance model performance.

                <h3>9x9 Sudoku Solver - Z3 SMT Solver</h3>
                <p>
                    Applied predicate logic to define Sudoku constraints using compound predicates.
                    Developed a Python script to generate SMT-Lib code, enabling the Z3 SMT solver to efficiently solve any 9x9 Sudoku.

                <h3>2D Pixel Art RPG Game (Java)</h3>
                <p>
                    Designed a modular and scalable game architecture using OOP principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to implement character classes, inventory systems, and game mechanics.
                    Developed an interactive 2D RPG game in Java by creating scalable character classes, inventory systems, and mob behavior.

                <h3>Reverse Engineering Assistant (Web UI)</h3>
                <p>
                    Developed a Django-based web interface for a reverse engineering debugger (binary to assembly disassembler) utilizing WinDbg. Built templates using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Created a websocket connection that updates debugger given user input.
                    Contributed to the creation of an AI chatbot designed to assist users in completing reverse engineering tasks, eliminating the need for specialized expertise in traditional reverse engineering tools.

                <h3>Computational Modeling for Enhanced Oil Recovery(EOR) Research</h3>
                <p>
                    Developed MATLAB code to compute partial derivatives for modeling dynamically evolving traveling viscosity waves. Conducted large-scale simulations using HPRC resources to analyze viscosity waves and viscous fingering across multiple grid sizes for enhanced oil recovery studies.
